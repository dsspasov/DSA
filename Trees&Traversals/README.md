Trees&Traversals

1. You are given a tree of N nodes represented as a set
of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each
in the range (0..N-1).
Write a program to read
the tree and find:
  1. the root node
  2. all leaf nodes
  3. all middle nodes
  4. the longest path in the tree
  5. * all paths in the tree with given sum S of their nodes
  6. * all subtrees with given sum S of their nodes

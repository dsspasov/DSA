1. Write a program that reads from the console a
sequence of positive integer numbers. The sequence
ends when empty line is entered. Calculate and print
the sum and average of the elements of the
sequence. Keep the sequence in List<int>. ->FindSumAndAverage.java

2.Write a program that reads N integers from the
console and reverses them using a stack. Use the
Stack<int> class.->ReverseSequenceOfNumbers.java

3.Write a method that finds the longest subsequence
of equal numbers in given List<int> and returns
the result as new List<int>. Write a program to
test whether the method works correctly. -> FindLongestSequence.java

4.Write a program that removes from given sequence 
all negative numbers.->RemoveNegativeNumbers.java

5.Write a program that removes from given sequence 
all numbers that occur odd number of times. ->RemoveOddOccur.java

6.Write a program that finds in given array 
of integers (all belonging to the range [0..1000])
how many times each of them occurs. ->NumberOfOccurrences.java

7.* The majorant of an array of size N is a value ]
that occurs in it at least N/2 + 1 times. Write a 
program to find the majorant of given array (if exists) ->MajorantOfArray.java

8. We are given the following sequence:
S1 = N;
S2 = S1 + 1;
S3 = 2*S1 + 1;
S4 = S1 + 2;
S5 = S2 + 1;
S6 = 2*S2 + 1;
S7 = S2 + 2;
...
Using the Queue<T> class write a program to print
its first 50 members for given N. -> MemebersOfSequence.java

9. * We are given numbers N and M and the following
operations:
a) N = N+1
b) N = N+2
c) N = N*2
Write a program that finds the shortest sequence of
operations from the list above that starts from N
and finishes in M. Hint: use a queue. ->ShortestSequence.java
